This is a simple portfolio devoped using React JS

# Language selection
The language selection is made using redux and react cookies. For easy access i recreated the <T> tag from Transifex, which only contains the text inside fragments, to leave out unnecessary dom nodes.
  
# Animations and design
  All the design and animations are designed in Adobe XD and implemented using css and styled components. For the frequently changing statebased styling i used styled object, to prevent vast class creation.
